## Overview  
This project implements a data analysis challenge using Python's Pandas library. It involves exploring, transforming, and analyzing a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company. The goal is to identify top customers, popular product categories, calculate profits, and answer real-world business questions.

## Project Details  
The project is designed to simulate practical data analysis in various fields such as data science, machine learning, and business intelligence. Users will import a dataset, explore its structure, perform transformations like calculating subtotals, and validate their findings through data analysis. The system also provides insights into the dataset by creating summaries and calculating metrics like total revenue and profits.

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.
3. Use Anaconda to create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n pandas-challenge python=3.10
   conda activate pandas-challenge
   ```
4. Install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   conda install pandas numpy jupyter
   ```

## Usage  
1. Open the `wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells step-by-step to explore, transform, and analyze the dataset.
3. Follow the prompts and instructions within the notebook to complete the data analysis tasks.

## Running the Notebook  
**Jupyter Notebook**: Start the Jupyter server using the command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then open the `wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb` file.

**Command Line**: Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and start the Jupyter server:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/project
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Features  
- Imports and explores the dataset to gather insights.
- Transforms the dataset by calculating subtotals, shipping costs, total prices, and profits.
- Validates calculations for specified orders to ensure accuracy.
- Summarizes and analyzes the data to identify top customers and revenue generators.
- Provides an option to format financial figures in millions of dollars for better presentation.

## Acknowledgments  
This project was developed as part of a Python data analysis learning exercise. It was shaped with input from instructors and class materials to provide a hands-on experience in data analysis using Pandas.
