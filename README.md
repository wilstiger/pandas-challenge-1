## Background

In this challenge, we dive into a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company. The goal is to explore and analyze the data to answer real-world business questions, such as identifying top customers and calculating profits. By the end of this task, you will have a practical understanding of data exploration, transformation, and analysis.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- .NET Core SDK (version 5.0 or later)
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
- Basic knowledge of C# and data analysis libraries

Challenge Instructions
Part 1: Explore the Data
Import the dataset and examine its structure in C#.
Use LINQ and data processing techniques to explore the data and answer questions such as:
What three item categories had the most entries?
Which subcategory had the most entries in the category with the most entries?
Which five clients had the most entries in the data?
Part 2: Transform the Data
Add new properties to your Order class to facilitate analysis:
Calculate the subtotal for each line.
Add a property for the shipping price.
Create a property for the total price using the subtotal, shipping, and sales tax.
Calculate the cost and profit for each line.
Part 3: Confirm Your Work
Confirm the accuracy of the calculations for specific orders:
Order ID 2742071: Total price should be $152,811.89
Order ID 2173913: Total price should be $162,388.71
Order ID 6128929: Total price should be $923,441.25
Part 4: Summarize and Analyze
Analyze the top 5 clients by quantity:
Calculate the total revenue for each client.
Create a summary class or structure showing total units, shipping price, revenue, and profit.
Write a brief summary of your findings.
Summary
In this project, we explored and analyzed a dataset using C#. We identified key business insights, such as top customers and profitable product categories, and validated our findings through data transformation and analysis.

### Explanation
- The project structure has been adapted for a C# application, using folders like `src/` and common naming conventions (`Program.cs`, `DataProcessor.cs`).
- References to Python-specific elements have been replaced with C# equivalents (e.g., LINQ, classes like `Order`).
- Build and run instructions are tailored for .NET Core CLI commands.
  
### Instructions
- Replace `https://github.com/your-username/pandas-challenge-1.git` with the URL of your repository.
- Add more details to sections like "Transform the Data" if there are specific C# data processing libraries (e.g., LINQ) you plan to use.
- Adjust the project structure and file names to match your actual C# project setup.
